1
00:01.000 --> 00:02.900
Experts tell us that kids need 60 minutes

2
00:03.000 --> 00:05.900
of activity a day to grow up healthy,

3
00:06.000 --> 00:08.900
and we know that regular physical activity boosts kids'

4
00:09.000 --> 00:12.900
concentration and creativity, and is even linked to improved

5
00:13.000 --> 00:14.900
academic performance.

6
00:15.000 --> 00:18.900
Best of all, moving around is just plain fun.

7
00:19.000 --> 00:22.900
And one of the most fun ways to get moving is by exploring

8
00:23.000 --> 00:24.900
America's great outdoors.

9
00:25.000 --> 00:27.900
No matter where you live, there are places near you to get out

10
00:28.000 --> 00:31.900
and get active, from biking around your neighborhood to playing

11
00:32.000 --> 00:34.900
tag or capture the flag in an urban park,

12
00:35.000 --> 00:37.900
from hiking on a mountain trail to paddling around a lake or

13
00:38.000 --> 00:39.900
catching an early morning wave.

14
00:40.000 --> 00:44.900
The great outdoors is America's first and best playground.

15
00:45.000 --> 00:46.900
So what are you waiting for?

16
00:47.000 --> 00:50.900
Grab a backpack and get moving outside with your family today.

17
00:51.000 --> 00:54.900
